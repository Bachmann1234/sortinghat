Harry Potter Sorting Hat.

I don't own the audio. I think I can make an argument for fair use but I can takedown if necessary

To install:
Install homebrew
brew install portaudio
pip install --allow-external  pyaudio pyaudio --allow-unverified pyaudio


running python sort.py builds and plays a script randomly generated from
some stalling lines a potential announcement of 'I KNOW', then finally the house.

Only the house is guaranteed, any other sound is random


And yes, the ravenclaw sound is kinda lame... sorry.. the hat does not seem to say it in the movie
